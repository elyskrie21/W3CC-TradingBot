(9/29/2022)David: so far i figured out the basics of python and have created an api key with binance-us. I have an account already set up with them so i can do some testing with that account. I still need to figure out how to use their api so i will create some tests in the __init__.py module. #https://docs.binance.us/?python#trade-order-endpoints 
run this to test their api connection: 'python3 __init__.py'
